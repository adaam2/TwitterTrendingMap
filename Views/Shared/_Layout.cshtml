                <h3>About Twitter & Trending</h3>
                <p>Trending is one of Twitter's key features; when something is Trending, it means that a topic or event is currently being discussed online by a significant majority of the Twittersphere. But what determines that something is trending? How can one determine topics and hashtags that have some sort of bearing on world events or are meaningful within a geographical context? Twitter uses an algorithm to determine the magic list of topics:
                <blockquote>
                <p>Twitter Trends are automatically generated by an algorithm that attempts to identify topics that are being talked about more right now than they were previously.</p>
                <p>The Trends list is designed to help people discover the ‘most breaking’ breaking news from across the world, in real-time. The Trends list captures the hottest emerging topics, not just what’s most popular.</p>

                <h3>Twitter Firehose vs Twitter Streaming API:</h3>
                <p>The Twitter API comes in three flavours: the Search API, the Streaming API and Twitter's Firehose. The Search API is used to filter on tweets that have already been made (i.e. historic tweets). The public Streaming API gives developers access to tweets being made in real-time. The public Stream can be filtered using various parameters such as hashtags (<i>track</i>, in Twitter lingo) and location. However the public Stream only returns around 1% of the total number of tweets being made in real-time. Twitter's Firehose guarentees 100% delivery of tweets matching pre-defined criteria. Very few people have access to the Firehose, and although Twitter have recently opened up the Firehose to a selected number of academic instutitions, still primarily the only way to gain access is through one of Twitter's data providers for a fee.</p>
                <h3>The Twitter Streaming API</h3>
                <p>Using the Twitter Streaming API v 1.1, this application intends to track geo-tagged tweets in real-time and analyze them to find meaningful subject correlations between tweets made in particular geographical areas. A C# wrapper of the Stanford Natural Language Parser is used to analyze tweets, turning them into machine-readable language and any correlations found in one particular area, <i>e.g. London & surrounding areas</i>, to find any subject matter correlations between tweets. <i>e.g. Earthquake in San Francisco.</i></p>
                <p>The criteria for tweets is that they are in English and have been geo-tagged with a set of latitude and longitudinal points.</p>
